## Technical Writing Projects ##

### WTL Thermostat ###
As part of the WTL Series Wireless Thermostat project I created Johnson Controls documents for a wireless pneumatic thermostat produced by Cypress Envirosystems. One of my colleagues began this original equipment manufacturer (OEM) project before she moved to another business unit and I replaced her. I continued her regular meetings with product managers and engineers in both Cypress and Johnson Controls to better understand the project scope and the product itself. I ordered the two thermostat models (standard and summer-winter) to test in our lab.

I adapted the existing Cypress documentation to conform to the Johnson Controls style guide, then sent our for a series of technical reviews where engineers provided updates on new, changed, and deprecated features. Concurrently, I sent the documents out for peer review by my fellow writers. I contributed a substantial amount of the content for the entire WTL document set, and wholly created the Summer-Winter Thermostat Quick Start Guide and QR pack sheets for both models.

### TEC3000 Thermostat ###
The TEC3000 is the Johnson Controls flagship thermostat, designed to fully integrate with the Metasys Building Automation System (BAS). During my time as thermostat writer, I made several updates to the TEC3000 documenation, particularly related to new features added in response to the Covid pandemic including epidemic control ventilation, occupant sensor ventilation, and CO2 monitoring ventillation. To complete these updates I worked with Johnson Controls product managers, engineers, and software developers to understand the new features and then test them using firmware installed on the existing TEC3000 models in the lab.

### Airwall ###
In 2022, Johnson Controls bought the cybersecurity company Tempered, to use their zero trust Airwall solution to protect and connect Johnson Controls building system devices. The Airwall solution comprises three distinct elements: the Airwall Gateway for protecting devices, the Airwall Agent for connecting to those protected devices from desktop, laptop or phone, and the Airwall Conductor management portal to configure the trust between gateways and agents via micro-segmented networks called overlays.

I managed the documentation transition and continue to maintain their original help site, [Airwall Help](https://webhelp.tempered.io/), adding new features at each release. I also work on new documents to cover Johnson Controls equipment with embedded Airwall software. Other projects include creating installation guides for two new types of Airwall Gateway, the AV3200g and AV3033.
