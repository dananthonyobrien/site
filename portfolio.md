# WTL Thermostat 

#### Project Description

As part of the WTL Series Wireless Thermostat project I created Johnson Controls documents for this wireless pneumatic thermostat produced by Cypress Envirosystems. One of my colleagues began this original equipment manufacturer (OEM) project before she moved to another business unit and I replaced her. I continued her regular meetings with product managers and engineers in both Cypress and Johnson Controls to better understand the project scope and the product itself. As part of my research, I ordered the two thermostat models (standard and summer-winter) to set up and test in our lab.

I adapted the existing Cypress documentation to conform to the Johnson Controls style guide, then sent it out for a series of technical reviews where engineers provided updates on new and deprecated features. Concurrently, I sent the documents out for peer review by my fellow writers. Overall, I contributed a substantial amount of the content for the WTL document set, and created a new Summer-Winter Thermostat Quick Start Guide. I also created QR pack sheets for the various pieces of WTL equipment as part of a company-wide sustainability initiative to limit the amount of paper that goes in the box with the product.

#### Product Description 

Pneumatic or air-driven thermostats control the HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems in an estimated 40% of corporate properties in the United States. Traditionally, upgrading these analog devices to digital meant replacing the entire system with wired technology, which is costly and invasive. The WTL Series Wireless Thermostat solves this problem by integrating with the building’s existing pneumatic tubes, rather than replacing them. The WTL Thermostat then connects wirelessly to the WTL Gateway and Control Server, which you can use for direct digital control and scheduling.

# TEC3000 Thermostat 

#### Project Description
During my time as thermostat writer, I made several updates to the TEC3000 Thermostat documentation, particularly related to new features added in response to the Covid pandemic. To complete these updates I worked with Johnson Controls product managers, engineers, and software developers to understand the new features and then test them using firmware installed on TEC3000 models in the lab.

#### Product Description 
The TEC3000 is the flagship Johnson Controls thermostat, designed to fully integrate with the Metasys Building Automation System (BAS) and a range of other Johnson Controls products. Interactive touchscreens provide an engaging user experience suitable for the modern workplace. Beyond the compelling design, the TEC3000 helps create healthier and more sustainable buildings, with new features including epidemic control, occupant sensors, and carbon dioxide monitoring.

# Airwall Cybersecurity Solution

#### Project Description

In 2022, Johnson Controls bought the cybersecurity company Tempered, to use their zero trust Airwall solution to protect and connect Johnson Controls building system devices. I managed the documentation transition and continue to maintain their original help site, [Airwall Help](https://webhelp.tempered.io/), adding new features at each release. I also work on new internal documents to cover Johnson Controls equipment with embedded Airwall software. Other projects include creating installation guides for two new types of Airwall Gateway, the AV3200g and AV3033. I am currently creating Johnson Controls data sheets and QR pack sheets for the full range of Airwall Gateways.

#### Product Desciption 

Smart buildings are vulnerable buildings. As the fire, access, security, and HVAC systems in our buildings become more connected with each other and with resources in the cloud, they also become increasingly open to cyberattack. Airwall provides cybersecurity for critical infrastructure such as office builings, factories, hospitals, universities, and company campuses. Without protection, these buildings are like your home with all the windows thrown open. Airwall closes these windows by cloaking physical devices and routing traffic through encrypted tunnels. Airwall is built on zero trust - nobody enters your home without an invitation. Airwall also micro-segments your internal networks to prevent bad actors free reign if they ever manage to get inside your firewall. Imagine a thief breaking into your house, only to find all the internal doors locked as well. 

The Airwall solution comprises three distinct elements: the Airwall Gateway for protecting devices, the Airwall Agent for connecting to those protected devices from desktop, laptop or phone, and the Airwall Conductor management portal to configure connections between gateways and agents through micro-segmented networks called overlays. The Conductor abstracts away complexity, allowing you to understand your network visually. Simply click and drag to create trust between two devices. A visiting service technician needs to access a chiller? You can grant a time-limited connection. You need to connect fifty of your engineers in one country with a campus of building automation systems in another? Just create a people group and a device group, then drag a single line of trust between them. Airwall: makes your life easier, and hackers' lives impossible.
