### Hobbies ###
In my spare time I read and review books for publications like the *Dublin Review of Books*. After publishing two non-fiction books, I am now writing my first novel based on the life of Irishman Daniel Florence O’Leary, who fought with Simón Bolívar for the independence of South America, and who in later life met some of the great figures of the nineteenth century, like the scientist Alexander Von Humboldt and the mathematician George Boole.
