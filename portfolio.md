## Technical Writing Projects ##

### WTL Thermostat ###
As part of the WTL Series Wireless Thermostat project I created Johnson Controls documents for an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) wireless pneumatic thermostat produced by Cypress Envirosystems. I first liased with product managers and engineers in both Cypress and Johnson Controls to understand the project scope and requirements. I then ordered the two versions of the thermostat to conduct testing in the lab. Finally, I adapted the existing documentation to conform to the Johnson Controls style guide, then sent our for a series of technical and peer reviews before publication.

### TEC3000 Thermostat ###
The TEC3000 is the Johnson Controls flagship thermostat, designed to fully integrate with the Metasys Building Automation System (BAS). During my time as lead thermostat writer, I made several updates to the TEC3000 documenation.
