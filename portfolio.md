## Technical Writing Projects ##

### WTL Thermostat ###
As part of the WTL Series Wireless Thermostat project I created Johnson Controls documents for an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) wireless pneumatic thermostat produced by Cypress Envirosystems. I first liased with product managers and engineers in both Cypress and Johnson Controls to understand the project scope and requirements. I then ordered the two versions of the thermostat to conduct testing in the lab. Finally, I adapted the existing documentation to conform to the Johnson Controls style guide, then sent our for a series of technical and peer reviews before publication.

### TEC3000 Thermostat ###
The TEC3000 is the Johnson Controls flagship thermostat, designed to fully integrate with the Metasys Building Automation System (BAS). During my time as thermostat writer, I made several updates to the TEC3000 documenation. To complete these updates I worked with Johnson Controls product managers, engineers, and software developers to understand the new features and then test them using firmware installed on the existing TEC3000 models in the lab.

### Airwall ###
In 2022, Johnson Controls bought the cybersecurity company Tempered, to use their zero trust Airwall solution to protect and connect Johnson Controls building system devices. On becoming the Airwall writer, I embedded with the Tempered team, taking part in their weekly meetings to continue producing their doumentation for the Airwall solution, which comprises three distinct elements: the Airwall Gateway for protecting your device or devices, the Airwall Agent for connecting with their devices from your laptop or phone, and the Airwall Conductor management portal to configure the trust between gateways and agents via micro-segmented networks called overlays.
