## Dan A. O'Brien ###

I am a writer, editor, and teacher, with a passion for texts and technology. I have written and edited several non-fiction books, and my work has also appeared in the [*Irish Times*](https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/how-edna-o-brien-found-sanctuary-among-jewish-american-writers-1.3980562), the [*Dublin Review of Books*](https://www.drb.ie/contributors-articles/-in-tags/tags/Dan-A-O-Brien), and on [*RTÉ*](https://www.rte.ie/brainstorm/2018/0903/991330-how-archives-illuminate-an-authors-work/). I am a life long learner, and am currently completing a Higher Diploma in Computer Science. I work as a technical writer at Johnson Controls, where my love of writing and tech flourishes.
